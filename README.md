I followed them from the course at udemy , the certificate of which is https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iGGqHQubzM6QTLLy7LixAVfQXoiwjQWr


About the scripts , 
* the craigslist.py is a simple manipulation of the *beautiful soup* an *requests* module of python

* codingbat.py is also based totally on *beautiful soup* and *requests* , a little complex than craigslist.py

* instagram.py is a webscraper made using *beautiful soup* , and *selenium* used to scrape images from Instagram. 

* Codeforces.ipnyb is based on the API of codeforces , and is used to find the number of users in India who is a red coder(above a certain rating in codeforces) and print them along with their handles.This is a small personal project *not* associated with the course.
